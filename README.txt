This is the two-dimension NOMP algorihtm written by MATLAB.
The following files are:
1. test_MNOMP2D_func.m: the main function to test 2D-NOMP algorihtm.
2. NOMP2D.m: the 2D-NOMP function
3. DectectNew_2D: to detect a new target from the 2D line spectrum
4. LeastSquare_2D: to adjuste the complex amplitudes of targets by least
    square method
5. RefineOne_2D.m: to refine the angular frequency of a particular target with
    NOMP method
6. RefineAll_2D.m: to refine the angular frequency of all the targets one by
    one.
